# AI-Powered llms.txt Generator

A tool to generate AI-optimized llms.txt files for websites to help AI models better understand content structure and context.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Descriptions**: Automatically create concise, informative descriptions for each page using ChatGPT 4o mini - chosen for its cost-efficiency and effectiveness for this specific task
- **Advanced Web Crawling**: Built on Puppeteer and JSDOM for reliable content extraction and structured data processing
- **Content Review**: Review and edit crawled links before generating descriptions
- **Robots.txt Compliant**: Respects website crawling preferences
- **Test Mode**: Option to limit crawl to 5 URLs for faster testing
- **URL Validation**: Ensures only valid and accessible URLs are processed
- **Smart Categorization**: Pages are categorized based on domain structure

## About llms.txt

### What is llms.txt?
The llms.txt file is an open standard that helps AI models better understand and interact with your website's content. Similar to how robots.txt guides search engines, llms.txt provides a curated index of your most important pages. Visit [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) for the official standard documentation.

It solves common AI crawling challenges by:

- Creating a clear content hierarchy
- Ensuring consistent discovery across subdomains
- Providing structured signals for valuable content
- Defining AI interaction preferences

### Benefits
- **Predictable AI Discovery** - Find and prioritize key content
- **Structured Content Signals** - Clear training indicators
- **Enhanced Content Understanding** - Better documentation comprehension
- **Consistent AI Interactions** - Reliable interpretation

### How the Generator Works
1. Input your website URL
2. The tool crawls your content using Puppeteer and JSDOM
3. Content structure is analyzed
4. AI generates page descriptions
5. AI creates an overall site description
6. Download the generated llms.txt file
7. Add to your website's root directory (like robots.txt)

**Before you start**: Add your OpenAI API key to the .env file to enable AI-powered content analysis. See [Setup Instructions](#getting-started).
